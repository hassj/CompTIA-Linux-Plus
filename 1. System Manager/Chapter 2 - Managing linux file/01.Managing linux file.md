# CHAPTER 2: MANAGING LINUX FILES

## Chapter 2.1 Linux File Management

1. Linux Distributions

Alma 8.5, Open suse 5.2, Linux 20.4 lts

- Commonly directory command lines:

`pwd` // current location of pointer

`echo $OLDPWD` or ` cd - `	// same function as above command

2. Module Overview

- Managing directories

- Understanding file metadata

- Edit FILES

- copy locally and remotely 

- Creating SSH Git repos

## Chapter 2.2: Working with linux command

- Print the file name of terminal contected to standard input

`ls -l $(tty)`

Explaination:
> Column 1: file type
>
> Column 2: file mode
>
> Column 3: hard link counts - number of name (how many names we are point into a files)
>
> Column 4: user ownership
> 
> Column 5: group ownership
>
> Column 6: file size in bytes
>
> Column 7: last modified time 
>
> column 8: file name itself

Note: FHS = consistency
		dnf = dandified yum
		
- show detail of files under certain folder `tree -L 1 /location/`


- Moving to old previous working directory on linux

` cd $OLDPWD` 	// move on to home working directory

`cd -` 			// move back to the old diretory

`mkdir -p /path/to/location` 	// make this folder is parent folder and then create some folder as needed

` mkdir /test/folder{1..10}` 	// creating folder1 to folder10 under test folder

## Chapter 2.3: Understanding timestamps

- create empty folder with 

`touch fodler_name`

- Display file or file system status include time of modified, access, change...(called metadat of folder)

`stat file_name`

`stat -c %x file_name`	// access time
`stat -c %y file_name`	// Modify
`stat -c %z file_name`	// Change 

Note
> Access: Last read
>
> Modify: data last modified
>
> Change: Metadata last change

- Change both access and modified times, change will always update

`touch file_name`

`touch -a file_name`	// changes access time

`touch -m file_name`	// changes modify time

- Copy file with preserve permison, ownership and timestamps with --archive mode

`cp -a source_file dest_file`

> note: -a is equal to -dR --preserve=all

## Chapter 2.4: Working with File metadata

- determine file type 

`file name_of_file`

- detail of file/directory such as metadata:

` stat file_name`

- Copy and Maintain the metadata of file/folder with archive mode `-a`

## Chapter 2.5: Understanding Linux Text editor

## Chapter 2.6: working with vim and nano editor

## Chapter 2.7: Stream editor sed

```
# sudo sshd -T | grep passwordauthentication
# sudo sed -Ei 's/(passwordauthentication) no/\1 yes/' /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# systemctl restart sshd
```

## Chapter 2.8: Understanding remote Copy

`find /var/www/html -name '*.html' -exec cp {} docs/ \;`
> by default option of find command is -print
>
> {} represent for all files found
>
> \; indicate that the end of subcommand instead of special character in bash. using it without "\" will treat as special character in bash shell.

whilst scp is good for copying single file to remote system, rsync is better equipped to copy complete directory structures and keep them up to data.

`#rsync -ave ssh source_folder des_folder`
> -a: archive mode
>
> -v: verbose
> 
> -e: external shell, specific remote shell to use

## Using git as remote VCS

you can initialize git server on a bare system instead of use public vcs such as github, gitlabt, etc...

on server

`git init --bare`

on client

` git clone user@server_ip/project`

or push code to the server

`git config --global user.email "abc@example.com"`
`git config --global user.name "abc"`
` git push origin master`

On opensuse distribution must install git-core package for using git

`sudo zypper in -y git-core`
